### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/galtes1/DoughFlowServer.git
```

2. **Set your connection string**

In `Program.cs`, update the connection string to match your local SQL Server instance:

```
string connectionString = "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME; Database=DoughFlowDb; Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;";
```

3. **Apply database migrations**

Open terminal in the project folder and run:

```
dotnet ef database update
```

```
dotnet run
```

The API should now be running at: `https://localhost:1463`

## üìÇ SQL Scripts

You‚Äôll find three SQL files in the `SQL/` folder:

- `1. ExpenseCategoriesScript.sql`
- `2. IncomeCategoriesScript.sql`
- `3. insertRecordYear2024.sql`

These are executed automatically through the migration logic on first-time setup.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes
